- 👀 I’m interested in developing solutions that run as a native app on mobile devices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop apps on Android using the Golang programming language replacing the need for Java and Kotlin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on clean code development of Android apps when "core" software should run native
